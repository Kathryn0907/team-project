# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions.

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)

The main platform that we will be using is Discord, including but not limited to text chats, voice chats, and screen sharing or video calls if needed.

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time?

We all agree on a window of replying within 24 hours but flexible when overloaded with school/exams.


* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)

Missing attendances including both labs and lectures, missing portion of their work, any issues that they have with accessing group materials, issues that teammate found in the code.


* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)

Listen and communicate with patience and understanding, encourage and acknowledge others contributions, treat others with respect, use polite language.

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
- some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.

Be kind and helpful to others, stay active in the team, try not to be silent and constantly contribute.


---

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)

We will use majority vote for decision making.

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)

- if the vote is split 3-3, then we will meet somewhere to discuss it in a respectful manner and try to either get compromise from either side and, at the end of that meeting, vote again on the matter. If the vote is still split 3-3, we will consult our TA for insight and their decision will be final. However, we commit to prioritizing teamwork spirit and what is in the team's best interest and to discuss matters with compassion and understanding for decision-making.


---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)

- It is each member's responsibility to complete their share of the work on time (or at least let teammates know when there will be delays).
- It is each member's responsibility to constructively share ideas and recieve criticism with grace and objectivity to ensure efficiency and open dialogue.
- It is each member's responsibility to ensure sufficient understanding and knowledge to execute their assigned tasks. This can be ensured by seeking assistance from teammates, TAs, instructors or other means of online assistance (like LearnAid).
